    How to:
Do not reward yourself for hardwork!
Tell yourself the hardwork is the reward
tell yourself “you enjoy the actual activity”; enjoy the challenge; enjoy the friction; the pain
do not layer other sources of dopamine to enjoy the activity
In the moment of most pain tell yourself that you love it and tell yourself that you will feel better later, there will be a dopamin release after completing the hardest part of the task

DO NOT:
Spike dopamine before the task
do not spike dopamine after the effort 

DO:
spike dopamin during the effort

Effects:
avoid peak in dopamine from end reward of activity 
this reward normally is very counter productive, leading you to become less and less motivated
This will make everything easier and more pleasurable
without the peaks and valleys of dopamine that external-reward-driven people experience, and you’ll obtain all the external rewards anyway
